# Automated Testing Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to help engineers start to unit test an existing application and start practicing the skills required in order to solve those real world problems.

## Pre-Requisites 

Docker - We'll be using Linux containers
.NET Core 2.2 SDK - The sample application uses ASP.NET Core
An IDE - Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider
An API Development Tool like Postman

## The Sample App - Keto Pal

**Keto** is a trendy diet that has helped many people lose weight, including myself. The diet consists of consuming *very little carbohydrates* including: sugar, many fruits, many starchy vegetables, and many packaged foods. General goal for someone to be doing this diet is to consume less than 50 grams of carbohydrates in a day. 

This sample application is meant to help someone like me understand what foods they could eat. This also includes helping someone track what they've already ate and help them not exceed their daily carb limit (e.g. 50 grams/day).
